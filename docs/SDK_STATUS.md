# Legaia SDK status — 2026-09-30

The SDK is functional for supported offline authoring workflows, but the full editor and runtime parity objective is incomplete. Gameplay verification is deferred at the user's request. No new game launch is needed to review the work below.

## Ready for offline review

- Scene workspace: source-based textured scenes, hierarchy selection, inspector, orthographic/top views, coordinate locator, authored/retail layers, and actor/decorative/shared-scenery X/Z handles. Shared scenery browser checks moved three instances while preserving366 unrelated instances and verified Undo on both axes.
- Script movement: verified MOVE_TO/NPC_RUN X/Z authoring, source/effective values, history and persistence, viewport targets with source-instruction navigation, and descriptor/streaming experimental output composition. Y, executed branches and actor identity remain unknown where evidence does not establish them.
- Animation: supported rigid clips can be previewed and exported. Channel edits and same-object retail/effective copy across frames/ranges use Apply/Undo/Discard. Existing-layout raw-record and readable channel-JSON download/import support retail/effective values. Raw-record checks pass shared-conflict, clear, persistence and package readback checks. Browser checks cover late responses, invalid selections and cross-object rejection. Shared clip users are explicitly listed. Proposed files can be inspected without applying them in both the model and scene viewers, restored, and returned to the same file form for explicit import.
- Model shapes: a diagnostic wireframe overlay displays all decoded triangle edges in the model viewer, including hidden edges. Focused WebGL and retail browser checks cover toggle, buffer reuse, vertex updates, picking and no project writes. Direct vector Inspector editing, per-vector retail reset, inspected-vertex camera location and exact-vector audit navigation are connected with focused browser checks. Existing-layout TMD, ordered-vertex OBJ and source-bound vertex/normal JSON replacements preserve source primitive/material data. Model build reports show scalar audits and navigate only to hash-matching authored previews. Normal-only edits are not visualized as lighting: the WebGL shader uses colors/textures without normal-based lighting. Equivalent oriented face order and relative indices passed exact roundtrip and isolated vertex edits on119 town01 models. A saved OBJ project passed Undo/Redo, reopen and package build.
- Output: supported edits compose into private packages or experimental disc exports. Input snapshots, hashes and reopened archive checks support later review. Package descriptions list emitted edit families; output collisions are rejected instead of silently replacing existing builds.

## Validation scope

The retail-enabled SDK discovery run at6407ade7 passed **351 tests in 140.443 seconds**. Log: `local-output/sdk-20260909/sdk-model-json-regression-20260912.log`. This supersedes the earlier349-test checkpoint. Subsequent model-file preview and direct-vector/reset/location/navigation work has focused checks; this full run predates those additions. Separate browser checks cover proposed animation inspection/return/import, model JSON downloads/import/Undo, and scalar build-report navigation with stale-hash rejection. Independent package checks cover model vertices, retail normal words and animation composition. Runtime and external Blender/Unity animated playback acceptance remain separate.

Recent private evidence lives under `local-output/sdk-20260909/`, including `sdk-suite-recheck-20260912.log`, `shared-scenery-multiple-check.json`, `shared-scenery-multiple-z-check.json`, `obj-equivalent-retail-20260912/report.json`, `animation-channel-copy-check.json`, `animation-effective-copy-check.json`, and `animation-copy-request-order-check.json`. These files are local evidence, not redistributable fixtures.

## Deferred gameplay

Use [the verification queue](legaia-gameplay-verification-queue.md) for saved input projects, exact artifacts and manual checks. NPC append/spawn behavior, script execution, animation playback, modified collision and visual behavior require their stated checks. Successful serialization does not establish gameplay acceptance. The user's wall-gap confirmation is bounded to that prior edit.

## Major unfinished work

- Arbitrary model topology/material replacement, general animation import and retargeting.
- Complete script/control-flow authoring, unknown records and scheduling behavior.
- Confirmed runtime actor identity and complete Unity-style live scene parity.
- Complete world-map behavior and unresolved MAPDSIP coverage.
- Remaining release/runtime acceptance, including the latest audio-lock build and deferred lifecycle/performance checks.
- Independent rendered acceptance of complete exported animations and wider scene parity.

See [feature coverage](FEATURE_MATRIX.md), [release parity](legaia-release-parity.md), [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), and [test plan](TEST_PLAN.md). The goal remains active; this report does not claim all offline work is exhausted.


Recent model interchange addition: source-bound complete vertex/normal JSON is
connected to model downloads, Apply shape, Undo/Redo and Save/Open. All119 town01
models round-tripped exactly. A retail normal-only model0009 probe preserved all
other TMD bytes and passed independent package-member readback. Browser checks
cover model0000 vertex upload, authored JSON download and Undo; they do not prove
runtime normal lighting. Saved probes are listed in the gameplay queue.

September 30 viewport authoring connection: enable **Wireframe overlay** and
Shift-click a projected vertex in an unposed model to open its exact object,
index and source XYZ in the vector Inspector. Selection does not apply changes.
Plain clicks and orbit drags do not select. Picking includes hidden vertices;
posed/proposed animation geometry, pending shape files and Live mode cannot
use this authoring shortcut. Retail browser checks verified the selected vector
and no submitted edits; projection checks cover center, behind-camera and
offscreen points.
